\subsubsection{Inter-Process Communication}
In an effort to maximize the potential error that can be handled, the localization code was written in C and compiled to native machine code.  This ensures a light weight run time environment and allows for manual memory management, preventing a poorly timed garbage collection from holding up the progress of the MMV.  This code runs in a separate daemon outside the managed C\# environment.  In order to communicate with this daemon, there is an additional C library that sets up two shared memory spaces and two semaphores to pass messages to and receive results from the daemon.  Finally, there is a C\# class that wraps this library, which ultimately provides access to the daemon from the C\# environment.
