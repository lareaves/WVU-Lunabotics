\subsubsection{AutonomyHandler}
The AutonomyHandler class is responsible for tracking the state of the robot, including its pose (position and orientation), arena area, and current objective.  It also actuates the motors to move the vehicle and operate the mining equipment.  To perform these responsibilities, it first localizes itself using range data from the LIDAR sensors.  Using the determined pose and the previous objective, the robot determines its new objective.  It then uses Hall effect sensor count from the motor controllers to move the vehicle a specified number of steps on either of four ways: forward, backwards, rotating clockwise, and rotating counterclockwise.  After the motion, the expected change in pose and the new range data are passed to the localization algorithm, which refines the position.
